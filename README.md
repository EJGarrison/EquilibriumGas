Equilibrium Gas Dynamics and Normal Shock Code

This code is the result of a final project I completed at UCLA for course MAE 250F: Hypersonic and High-temperature Gas Dynamics. The report that I wrote is available upon reasonable request. 

I am publishing this code for potential employers to showcase a project I completed.
